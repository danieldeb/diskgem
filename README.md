### What is DiskGem?
DiskGemÂ® is software for secure file transfer over SFTP.

### Questions and Answers

- **Question:** _Will DiskGem support Microsoft Windows?_
- **Answer:** DiskGem currently is not available natively on Windows due to cmd.exe not supporting unicode, 256-color or emojis. However, DiskGem is already fully supported on Windows via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) which, incidentally, is also used entirely to write DiskGem itself.
